# Analysis-of-brightfield-images
Certain microscopy methods allow us to image cells without using any fluorescent markers. In this project you will be working with data that has been obtained from differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. The task will focus on cell detection and segmentation. This project will requires some experience in image analysis and machine learning.
